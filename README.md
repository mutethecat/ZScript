# ZScript
A language so simple, anyone who can type can code in it.
# Installation
Simply run the run.bat file. ZScript is currently only designed for windows, but comes with all its dependencies out of the box.
# How does ZScript work?
ZScript uses OpenAI to convert fake code into real code. The ZScript compiler will automatically save any compiled files to increase efficiency
